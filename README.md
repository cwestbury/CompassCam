# CompassCam
This is a compass that uses the iPhone's camera and internal magnetic heading to display directions on your screen. Each direction will be in the center of your screen at its appropriate heading (i.e. N will be centered at 0ยบ and S will be centered at 180ยบ). I wrote a formula that should center the label on any device you use.
